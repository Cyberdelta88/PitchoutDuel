# PitchoutDuel
The pitchout duel is a minigame, two players are on an ice plateform above lava whith a punch bow and a knockback stick. The first to push the other player 8
times wins.
To configure the spawn points use the /setrespawn {x coords} {y coords} {z coords}, the /setredspawn  {x coords} {y coords} {z coords} and the /setbluespawn {x coords} {y coords} {z coords}. Then use the /team to join the blue and the red team. Finally use the /start to start the game and enjoy.
If you have any problem, you can contact me on discord at Delta88#4155.
